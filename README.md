# 2015 US Flights

## This project was conceived as a self-challenge to be completed within 48 hours, aka one weekend.

### The challenge is split into two main parts.

#### 1. Data Visualization and Data Analysis 
Use `DEPARTURE_DELAY` as your target
----
##### In this Section your objective is to create the following graths:

1. Distribution of Delays by Airline:
- Create a chart showing the distribution of delays (both positive and negative) for each airline.
- The chart should allow for easy comparison between the companies.

2. Relationship Between Flight Distance and Delays:
- Create a scatter plot that relates flight distance to departure delay.
- Identify any visible trends or patterns.

3. Delays by Airline:
- Visualize how delays vary throughout the day.
- Consider showing the average delays by hour of departure.

4. Temporal Analysis of Delays:
- Analyze how flight delays varied throughout the year 2015.
- Create a line or bar chart showing the monthly variation of delays.

5. Map of Delays by Airport:
- Create a map visualization showing the location of airports with the quantity or percentage of delays.
- This may involve integrating geographical data of airports with flight delays.

##### Include legends, titles, axis labels, and any other annotations to make the visualizations easily interpretable.
##### Provide a brief description or interpretation of the insights gained from each graph.

### 2. Machine Learning Model Training

#### Model Objective:Your goal is to predict a binary variable if a flight is going to departure an hour late or not.

#### **ATENTION** You are only allowed to use variables that the plane would have until the moment of the takeoff. 

#### You must:
1. Perform data cleaning and preparation.
2. Divide the data into training and test sets.
3. Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, etc.
4. Discuss possible insights gained from the model and suggestions for future improvements.

Finally, breath!! Stop for a moment to realize how much you have accomplished in such a short period of time. \
In a day or two, come back. Review the code, take notes. You will be ready for the next time. 

### Data was taken from [Kaggle's 2015 Flight Delays and Cancellations](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays)

### Have fun! Every Second Counts
